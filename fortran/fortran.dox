/** @defgroup fortran Dballe fortran bindings

Fortran bindings of Dballe.  The bindings offer two different interfaces: a
simplified interface and a full interface.  The simplified interface allows for
writing code quickly, while the full interface exports every part of Dballe,
making it possible to write more complex programs, such as programs that run
run more queries at the same time, or that perform queries while getting the
results of other queries.
