  * Fixed land and sea stations, like synops and buoys
  * Mobile stations: ships, airplanes
  * Soundings: temp, pilot
  * METAR reports
  * Satellite strides (decode only)

Description: Interpret weather reports into physycal data, and vice-versa
 The library implements dba_msg, a storage structure for physical data
 precisely located in space and time.  The structure can be:
 .
  * Filled in with data from weather reports encoded BUFR, CREX or AOF formats
  * Used to create BUFR or CREX weather reports
  * Read from disk in BUFR, CREX or AOF files
  * Written to disk in BUFR or CREX files
  * Stored into a DB-All.e database via libdballe-db
  * Queried from a DB-All.e database via libdballe-db
 .
 The representation is in 7 dimensions: latitude and longitude geographic
 coordinates, table driven vertical coordinate, reference time, table driven
 observation and forecast specification, table driven data type.
 .
 dba_msg is a very convenient way of accessing weather data already digested as
 properly located physical quantities, as well as as a common middle ground for
 performing conversions between the various supported message formats.

Description: Smart on-disk database for working with weather data as physical quantities
 Fast on-disk database where meteorological observed and forecast data can be
 stored, searched, retrieved and updated.
 .
 The main characteristics of the DB-ALL.e database are:
 .
  * To make computation easier, data is stored as physical quantities,
    that is, as measures of a variable in a specific point of space and
    time, rather than as a sequence of report.
  * Representation is in 7 dimensions: latitude and longitude geographic
    coordinates, table driven vertical coordinate, reference time,
    table driven observation and forecast specification, table driven
    data type.
  * It allows to store extra information linked to the data, such as
    confidence intervals for quality control.
  * It allows to store extra information linked to the stations.
  * Variables can be represented as real, integer and characters, with
    appropriate precision for the type of measured value.
  * It is based on physical principles, that is, the data it contains are
    defined in terms of homogeneous and consistent physical data. For
    example, it is impossible for two incompatible values to exist in the
    same point in space and time.
  * It can manage fixed stations and moving stations such as airplanes or
    ships.
  * It can manage both observational and forecast data.
  * It can manage data along all three dimensions in space, such as data
    from soundings and airplanes.
  * Report information is preserved. It can work based on physical
    parameters or on report types.
  * Can concurrently access multiple MySQL and SQLite databases via ODBC

Description: Database for punctual meteorological data (Command line tools)
 DB-All.e is a fast on-disk database where meteorological observed and
 forecast data can be stored, searched, retrieved and updated.
 .
 This framework allows to manage large amounts of data using its simple
 Application Program Interface, and provides tools to visualise, import
 and export in the standard formats BUFR, AOF and CREX.
 .
 The main characteristics of DB-ALL.e are:
 .
  * Fortran, C, C++ and Python APIs are provided.
  * To make computation easier, data is stored as physical quantities,
    that is, as measures of a variable in a specific point of space and
    time, rather than as a sequence of report.
  * Internal representation is similar to BUFR and CREX WMO standard
    (table code driven) and utility for import and export are included
    (generic and ECMWF template).
  * Representation is in 7 dimensions: latitude and longitude geographic
    coordinates, table driven vertical coordinate, reference time,
    table driven observation and forecast specification, table driven
    data type.
  * It allows to store extra information linked to the data, such as
