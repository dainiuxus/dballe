  abstract =     "The need for communication among a multiplicity of
                 cooperating roles in user interface development
                 translates into the need for a common set of interface
                 design representation techniques. The important
                 difference between design of the interaction part of
                 the interface and design of the interface software
                 calls for representation techniques with a behavioral
                 view -- a view that focuses on user interaction rather
                 than on the software. The User Action Notation (UAN) is
                 a user- and task-oriented notation that describes
                 physical (and other) behavior of the user and interface
                 as they perform a task together. The primary
                 abstraction of the UAN is a user task. The work
                 reported here addresses the need to identify temporal
                 relationships within user task descriptions and to
                 express explicitly and precisely how designers view
                 temporal relationships among those tasks. Drawing on
                 simple temporal concepts such as events in time and
                 preceding and overlapping of time intervals, we
                 identify basic temporal relationships among tasks;
                 sequence, waiting, repeated disjunction, order
                 independence, interruptibility, one-way
                 interleavability, mutual interleavability, and
                 concurrency. The UAN temporal relations, through the
                 notion of modal logic, offer an explicit and precise
                 representation of the specific kinds of temporal
                 behavior that can occur in asynchronous user
                 interaction without the need to detail all cases that
                 might result.",

                 be a difficult task. As far as the non-interactive part
                 of the application is concerned, designers can find
                 support in the field of software engineering, using
                 object-oriented design methods for example. With regard
                 to the user interface per se, a number of interactive
                 tools (interface builders) are available, that allows
                 creating interactively the look and feel of the
                 interface. However, relating an object-oriented design
                 with a proper user-interface design is still a matter
                 of craft and experience, and few techniques permit the
                 seamless integration of the two. The work presented
                 here aims at bridging this gap. The paper proposes a
                 visual language, based on Petri nets, for the design of
                 the dialogue of interactive systems. This language
                 allows specifying both activation and rendering on the
                 one hand, and provides a seamless integration with an
                 object-oriented design on the other.",

  abstract =     "'Cognitive dimensions' are features of computer
                 languages considered purely as information structures
                 or notations. They therefore apply to many types of
                 language -- interactive or programming, high or low
                 level, procedural or declarative, special purpose or
                 general purpose. They are 'cognitive' dimensions
                 because they control how (or whether) the preferred
                 cognitive strategy for design-like tasks can be
                 adopted; it has repeatedly been shown that users prefer
                 opportunistic planning rather than any fixed strategy
                 such as top-down development. The dimension analysis
                 makes it easier to compare dissimilar interfaces or
                 languages, and also helps to identify the relationship
                 between support tools and programming languages: the
                 support tools make it possible to use opportunistic
                 planning with notations that would otherwise inhibit
                 it.",
