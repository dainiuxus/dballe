DB-All.e operations are grouped into *transactions*, which succeed or fail as a
complete unit, and can never be only partially complete.

In Fortran, a transaction begins with [idba_begin][] and ends with
[idba_commit][]. If [idba_commit][] is not called, all modifications done using
that session handle will be discarded as if they had never happened. When
[idba_commit][] is called, all modifications done using that session handle are
saved and will be available for others to read.

For example, this code will print `0` and then `1`:

```fortran
idba_connect(dbhandle, "dbtype://info?wipe=true")

! Write some data
idba_begin(dbhandle, handle_write, "write", "write", "write")
â€¦
idba_prendilo(handle_write)

! Read it before calling idba_commit: the modifications are not yet visible
! outside the session that is writing them
idba_begin(dbhandle, handle_read, "read", "read", "read")
idba_voglioquesto(handle_read, count)
print*, count
idba_commit(handle_read)
idba_commit(handle_write)

! Read if after calling idba_commit: the modifications are visible now
idba_begin(dbhandle, handle_read, "read", "read", "read")
idba_voglioquesto(handle_read, count)
print*, count
idba_commit(handle_read)
```

## SQLite specific limitations

SQLite does not support writing data while another session is reading it. This
means that `idba_commit` will exit with an error if there is a read session
open. For example, this code will fail:

```fortran
idba_begin(dbhandle, handle_write, "write", "write", "write")
idba_begin(dbhandle, handle_read, "read", "read", "read")
idba_commit(handle_write) ! fails: there is a read session open
idba_commit(handle_read)
```

and this code will work:

```fortran
idba_begin(dbhandle, handle_write, "write", "write", "write")
idba_begin(dbhandle, handle_read, "read", "read", "read")
idba_commit(handle_read)
idba_commit(handle_write) ! succeeds: no read session is open
```
