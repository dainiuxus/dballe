Fortran dballe functions
========================

DB-All.e is a fast, temporary, on-disk database where meteorological data can
be stored, searched, retrieved and updated.  To make computation easier, data
is stored as physical data, that is, as measures of a variable in a specific
point of space and time, rather than as a sequence of reports.

This is a quick introduction to DB-All.e.  It is intended as a quick read to
get up to speed, and as a quick reference for everyday use.
