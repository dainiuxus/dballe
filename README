===============================================================

Introduction
------------

DB-All.e is a fast on-disk database where meteorological observed and
forecast data can be stored, searched, retrieved and updated.

This framework allows to manage large amounts of data using its simple
Application Program Interface, and provides tools to visualise, import
and export in the standard formats BUFR, AOF and CREX.

The main characteristics of DB-ALL.e are:

 * Fortran, C, C++ and Python APIs are provided.
 * To make computation easier, data is stored as physical quantities,
   that is, as measures of a variable in a specific point of space and
   time, rather than as a sequence of report.
 * Internal representation is similar to BUFR and CREX WMO standard
   (table code driven) and utility for import and export are included
   (generic and ECMWF template).
 * Representation is in 7 dimensions: latitude and longitude geographic
   coordinates, table driven vertical coordinate, reference time,
   table driven observation and forecast specification, table driven
   data type.
 * It allows to store extra information linked to the data, such as
   confidence intervals for quality control.
 * It allows to store extra information linked to the stations.
 * Variables can be represented as real, integer and characters, with
   appropriate precision for the type of measured value.
 * It is based on physical principles, that is, the data it contains are
   defined in terms of homogeneous and consistent physical data. For
   example, it is impossible for two incompatible values to exist in the
   same point in space and time.
 * It can manage fixed stations and moving stations such as airplanes or
   ships.
 * It can manage both observational and forecast data.
 * It can manage data along all three dimensions in space, such as data
   from soundings and airplanes.
 * Report information is preserved. It can work based on physical
   parameters or on report types.
 * It is temporary, to be used for a limited time and then be deleted.
 * Does not need backup, since it only contains replicated or derived data.
 * Write access is enabled for its users.

Building DB-All.e
-----------------

DB-All.e is already packaged in both .rpm and .deb formats, and that provides
easy installation for most Linux distributions.

If you want to build and install DB-All.e yourself, you can proceed as in most
other Unix software::

  ./configure
  make
  make install


Getting started
---------------

DB-All.e requires ODBC access to a MySQL database for most of its
functionality.

To set up DB-All.e on the MySQL side, you need to create a database and grant
users create table, drop table, insert, delete and select access.  MySQL needs
to run with InnoDB support.

To set up ODBC access to the database (this is called a DSN) you can run a
graphical configuration file like ODBCConfig.  Otherwise, this is a sample
.odbc.ini you can use::

  [dballe]
  Description     = MySQL
  Driver          = MySQL
  Server          = localhost
  Database        = dballe

Once this is set up, you can initialise the DB-All.e database using the command::

  dbadb wipe --dsn=dballe --user=username [--pass=password]

"--user" can be omitted if it is the same as your Unix username; "--pass" can
be omitted if the user has no password.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation for all commandline tools can be found in their manpages.  All
commandline tools also have extensive commandline help that can be accessed
using the "--help" option.

The Fortran API is documented in the fapi.pdf document.

The C API and all the C internals are documented through Doxygen.

Administration and maintanance of DB-All.e are covered in the guide.pdf
document.


Testing DB-All.e
----------------

Unit testing can be run using "make check", but it requires an existing DSN
connection to a MySQL database, which should be called 'test'.  Please note
that unit testing functions will wipe existing DB-All.e tables on the test DSN
database.
