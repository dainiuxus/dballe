    genericName: DB-All.e
    longDescription: |
      DB-All.e is a fast on-disk database where meteorological observed and
      forecast data can be stored, searched, retrieved and updated.


      This framework allows to manage large amounts of data using its simple
      Application Program Interface, and provides tools to visualise, import and
      export in the standard formats BUFR, and CREX.


      The main characteristics of DB-ALL.e are:


      - Fortran, C, C++ and Python APIs are provided.

      - To make computation easier, data is stored as physical quantities, that
      is, as measures of a variable in a specific point of space and time,
      rather than as a sequence of report.

      - Internal representation is similar to BUFR and CREX WMO standard (table
      code driven) and utility for import and export are included (generic and
      ECMWF template).

      - Representation is in 7 dimensions: latitude and longitude geographic
      coordinates, table driven vertical coordinate, reference time, table
      driven observation and forecast specification, table driven data type.

      - It allows to store extra information linked to the data, such as
      confidence intervals for quality control.

      - It allows to store extra information linked to the stations.

      - Variables can be represented as real, integer and characters, with
      appropriate precision for the type of measured value.

      - It is based on physical principles, that is, the data it contains are
      defined in terms of homogeneous and consistent physical data. For example,
      it is impossible for two incompatible values to exist in the same point in
      space and time.

      - It can manage fixed stations and moving stations such as airplanes or
      ships.

      - It can manage both observational and forecast data.

      - It can manage data along all three dimensions in space, such as data
      from soundings and airplanes.

      - Report information is preserved. It can work based on physical
      parameters or on report types.

      - It is temporary, to be used for a limited time and then be deleted.

      - Does not need backup, since it only contains replicated or derived data.

      - Write access is enabled for its users.
